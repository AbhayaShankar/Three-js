This is a Three-js project which i followed from [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqEa8fTxypQ&t=592s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery)

For a long time I have been thinking of working on three-js. It looks so good when something 3-d animation happens.
I figured out I would have to start somewhere. So, I decided to work on this.

It was a great experience working on this, but at the same time : Incredibly difficult to understand some of the basic concepts of Lights, shadows, mesh etc and many more terminologies you will come across this tech stack which is the sole building blocl for 3-js.

Overall It was a great experience and I know I will come back to this some time in the future.
